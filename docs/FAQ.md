## Why did you have the idea to make an OS from scratch?

> **uhh yes?**

Because I wanted to learn how hardware and software works together.

No. C is the best programming language ever made. Don't dare use other languages than C and x86 ASM.

## This is a hobby or you are trying to build a professional OS?

This OS/Kernel is a hobby project, as in [SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md). I am not trying to build a professional OS.

## Why did you choose the name Wind/Tempest?

Wind is like lightweight and calm frontend. (the OS or vision of the user) Tempest is like a stormy sea with strong winds (that is the kernel).

There is none for now, but I will add it soon.

For now x86-64. But in a future (I don't know when) I plan to support other architectures like ARM and etc.
