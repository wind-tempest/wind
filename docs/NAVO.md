# NAVO (NAVO Ain’t Vanilla Operating-system)

## What is NAVO?

NAVO is a compatibility layer for Wind. It traps DOS system calls and turns them into Wind calls. Run DOS apps **natively**, no emulation bloat.

## What's the Point?

Old DOS software shouldn’t be a risk. NAVO sandboxes it so nothing crashes your OS or behaves shady.

## What's the Goal?

Run DOS apps on Wind with equal or better speed than real DOS, but with modern security and stability. No hype, no junk. Just straight-up working.

## Why?

Why not? It's fun.
