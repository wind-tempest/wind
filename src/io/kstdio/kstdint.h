 * ============================================================================
 *
 *  Overview:
 *  This source file is part of the Wind OS and Tempest Kernel project, a fully
 *  open-source operating system kernel developed to provide a robust, scalable,
 *  and efficient platform optimized for modern hardware and user-centric freedom.
 *
 *  Project Scope:
 *  Wind/Tempest targets a modular architecture supporting symmetric multiprocessing,
 *  preemptive multitasking, fine-grained memory management, and extensible driver
 *  frameworks. The system emphasizes low latency, high throughput, and
 *  predictable behavior for both user-space applications and kernel subsystems.
 *
 *  Licensing Terms:
 *  The Wind/Tempest source code is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public
 *  License (AGPL) version 3 or any later version, published by the Free Software Foundation.
 *  This license guarantees that all derivative works remain open and freely
 *  available, particularly addressing network use cases to enforce sharing.
 *
 *  You are authorized to copy, modify, distribute, and use this software,
 *  provided that all modifications and derivatives comply with the AGPL terms.
 *  Inclusion of proper attribution and licensing notices is mandatory in redistributions.
 *

 *  a particular purpose, or non-infringement of third-party rights.
 *  Under no circumstances shall the authors, contributors, or copyright holders be liable
 *  for any damages arising directly or indirectly from the use or inability to use
 *  this software, including data loss, system failures, or other incidental damages.
 *
 *  Contribution Guidelines:
 *  Contributions to the Wind/Tempest project are welcome and encouraged.
 *  Contributors must agree to license their contributions under the same AGPL terms.
 *  When submitting patches, please ensure they adhere to the project's coding standards,
 *  include proper documentation, and maintain backward compatibility where possible.
 *
 *  Security and Stability:
 *  The kernel maintains rigorous coding practices to minimize security vulnerabilities.
 *  Regular code audits, testing, and community reviews are integral to the project's
 *  ongoing stability and security posture.
 *  Users and developers should report issues promptly via official channels.
 *
 *  Documentation and Support:
 *  Comprehensive documentation including API references, architecture overviews,
 *  and development guides are available on the official website:
 *    https://wind.infernointeractive.win
 *  Community support can be found through mailing lists, forums, and issue trackers
 *  hosted on the project's main repository.
 *
 *  Additional Notes:
 *  This kernel is designed to be hardware agnostic, supporting a wide range of
 *  architectures and devices. Modularity in subsystems allows customization
 *  for embedded, desktop, and server deployments.
 *
 *  By using or modifying this code, you agree to uphold the principles of free and
 *  open-source software, contributing back improvements to foster collective progress.
