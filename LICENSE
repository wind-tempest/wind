This license document may be copied and distributed verbatim by anybody, but it cannot be altered.

- Introduction

The Liberty Software License (LSL), which was developed with the principles of robust copyleft and software freedom in mind, was designed to safeguard users rights to use, modify, and distribute software while adding new clauses to address modern concerns like DRM restrictions and AI training.

- TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

	The following terms are used throughout this License:

	* "This License": Refers to the Liberty Software License.

	* "The Program": Refers to any software or work licensed under this License.

	* "You" or "User": Any individual or legal entity exercising rights under this License.

	* "Source Code": The ideal format for program modifications, it includes all necessary files, scripts, documentation, configuration files, and instructions that a competent developer would need to completely comprehend, build, test, and alter the program without the need for extra proprietary, cryptic, or purposefully obfuscated materials.

	* "Object Code": Any version of the software that is not source code.

	* "Modify": To alter the program or run it in accordance with it.

	* "Distribute": To provide the program or copies of it to more individuals in whatever method. This license is expanded to cover contemporary issues like DRM and artificial intelligence by the "Liberty Clauses" in Section 6.

1. Basic Permissions.

	You may run the unmodified Program, copy and distribute verbatim copies, and modify and distribute modified versions under the terms of this License, provided you comply with all its terms.

2. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

	When you distribute a modified version, the entire work must be licensed under this License. You must retain all notices referencing this License.

3. Network Use.

	If the Program is used to provide functionality over a network, the complete corresponding source code must be made available to all users interacting with it.

4. Additional Terms.

	You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted herein except those expressly permitted by this License.

5. Liberty Clauses.

	* 5.1. No Use for AI Training.

		The Program and any derivative works may not be used, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of training, improving, fine-tuning, validating, benchmarking, or supplementing any Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or related data-driven systems ("AI Systems"), including but not limited to the collection, extraction, or incorporation of any part of the Program's code, data, or output as training data, without explicit prior written permission from the original author.

		All AI-related activities using the Program must be documented by users in thorough, verifiable records, including logs, access histories, and usage reports.  Users must promptly submit such documentation to the original author or designated agent for compliance verification within 15 days of receiving a request. The rights granted under this License will be immediately terminated for failure to comply with this record-keeping and disclosure requirement, which may also lead to legal action against the violation. This provision covers all uses, whether they are experimental, non-commercial, or commercial.

		Furthermore, any attempt to circumvent or obfuscate AI-related use, including but not limited to use of anonymization, encryption, or indirect data processing, shall be considered a violation subject to the same penalties.

	* 5.2. Anti-DRM.

		No part of this software may be included in or linked to any system, service, or product that restricts usersâ€™ ability to use, study, modify, or share the Program by any means, including but not limited to Digital Restrictions Management (DRM), license enforcement, online activation, or proprietary control mechanisms.

	* 5.3. Source Code Access.

		Any distribution of the Program or derivative works must include the complete, human-readable source code under this License, without obfuscation, encryption, or access restrictions.

	* 5.4.1 Personal Use.

		You may use, study, and modify the Program for personal, educational, or non-commercial purposes without being required to redistribute modifications.

	* 5.4.2 Commercial Use.

		Any commercial use of the Program or derivative works, including but not limited to selling, sublicensing, offering as a paid service, embedding in products sold or monetized, or any other use that directly or indirectly results in financial gain, requires that the complete corresponding source code be made publicly available under this License.

6. No Additional Limitations.

	No further conditions may be imposed on the rights granted by this License.

7. Termination.

	Rights under this License terminate automatically if its terms are violated and not remedied within 30 days of notice.

8. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

	Acceptance of this License is not required simply by using or owning a copy of the Program.

9. Disclaimer of Warranty.

	The program is offered "as is," with no warranties, either explicit or implied.

10. Limitation of Liability.

	In the event that the program causes injury, the developers will not be held responsible.

11. The full agreement.

	The entire agreement between the parties about the Program is contained in this license.
