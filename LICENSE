This license document may be copied and distributed verbatim by anybody, but it cannot be altered.

- Introduction

The Liberty Software License (LSL), which was developed with the principles of robust copyleft and software freedom in mind, was designed to safeguard users rights to use, modify, and distribute software while adding new clauses to address modern concerns like DRM restrictions and AI training.

- TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

	The following terms are used throughout this License:

	* "This License": Refers to the Liberty Software License.

	* "The Program": Refers to any software or work licensed under this License.

	* "You" or "User": Any individual or legal entity exercising rights under this License

	* "Source code": The format for program modifications, it includes all files, scripts, documentation, configuration and instructions that a competent developer would need to completely
	build, test and alter the program without the need for extra proprietary, cryptic or purposefully obfuscated materials.

	* "DRM (Digital Rights Management)": Any technology, mechanism, or system that restricts, controls, or limits a user's ability to access, use, modify, share, or distribute the Program, including but not limited to license enforcement, online activation, encryption, or proprietary control mechanisms.

	* "Object Code": Any version of the software that is not source code.

	* "Modify": To change the program or run it consistent with it.

	* "Distribute": To make copies of the software or the program itself available to other people in any way.  Section 6, the "Liberty Clauses," deals with modern topics like AI and DRM (Digital Rights Management)

1. Basic Permissions.

	You may run the unmodified Program, copy and distribute verbatim copies, and modify and distribute modified versions under the terms of this License, provided you comply with all its terms.

2. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

	When you distribute a modified version, the entire work must be licensed under this License.  You must retain all notices referencing this License.

3. Network Use.

	If the Program is used to provide functionality over a network, the complete corresponding source code must be made available to all users interacting with it.

4. Additional Terms.

	You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted herein except those expressly permitted by this License.

5. Clauses of Liberty

	* 5.1. No Use for AI Systems.

		The Program and any derivative works may not be used, directly or indirectly, in any manner, to train, improve, validate, test, mine, or supply data to Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning Systems ("AI Systems"), including but not limited to:

		Collection, extraction, analysis, or incorporation of any part of the Programâ€™s code, data, output, or documentation;

		Providing the Program or its derivatives to third parties for the purpose of use in AI Systems;

		Inclusion of the Program in datasets, pipelines, libraries, or services that feed, train, or fine-tune AI models.

		Any attempt to circumvent this restriction, including anonymization, encryption, combination with other software, or indirect usage, shall be considered a serious violation of this License.

		All users must maintain verifiable records of any interaction of the Program with automated systems or data processing and provide such records to the author upon request within 15 days.  Failure to comply with this requirement will result in immediate termination of rights under this License, without prejudice to further legal action.

	* 5.2. Anti-DRM.

		No part of this software may be included in or linked to any system, service, or product that restricts users ability to use, study, modify, or share the Program by any means, including but not limited to Digital Restrictions Management (DRM), license enforcement, online activation, or proprietary control mechanisms.

	* 5.3. Source Code Access.

		Any distribution of the Program or derivative works must include the complete, human-readable source code under this License, without obfuscation, encryption, or access restrictions.

	* 5.4.1 Personal Use.

		For non-commercial, educational or personal use, you may study, use, and change the Program without having to redistribute changes.
